This document is a thorough overview of my process for building a predictive model for Kaggle's Titanic competition.
I will provide all my essential steps in this model as well as the reasoning behind each decision I made.
This model achieves a score of 82.78%, which is in the top 3% of all submissions at the time of this writing. 
This is a great introductory modeling exercise due to the simple nature of the data, 
yet there is still a lot to be gleaned from following a process that ultimately yields a high score.
